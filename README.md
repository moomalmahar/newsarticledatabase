# newsarticledatabase

run the mysql script newsarticledatabasestuff.sql
this creates your database and adds some articles

You can visit admin/home.php to create an admin login account and use the same page to actually log in. 
which takes you to the index page of all the articles added
here you can add/edit articles
all new added articles are deactivated by default and an admin can activate them
An admin can sort the articles manually by going to "Sort Articles". This would be the only way a user can view the article. Only the admin can sort them


For having a view as a user localhost/index.php would do.
