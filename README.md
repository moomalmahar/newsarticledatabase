# newsarticledatabase

<p>run the mysql script newsarticledatabasestuff.sql </p>
<p>this creates your database and adds some articles </p>

<p>You can visit admin/home.php to create an admin login account and use the same page to actually log in.</p> 
<p>which takes you to the index page of all the articles added</p>
<p>here you can add/edit articles</p>
<p>all new added articles are deactivated by default and an admin can activate them</p>
<p>An admin can sort the articles manually by going to "Sort Articles". This would be the only way a user can view the article. Only the admin can sort them</p>


<p>For having a view as a user localhost/index.php would do.</p>
